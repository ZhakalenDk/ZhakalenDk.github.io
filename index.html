                    <p>New custom handwritten Launcher for YWDE</p>
                    <div id="NewText">
                        <p>
                            As we're working towards the implementation of our starter region "Wellrock Swamps" we decided that we would improve the tester to developer communication. Our solution was to develop a launcher for our game, which you can see below.
                        </p>
                        <img id="Image" src="Images/Launcher.JPG" alt="Failed to load Image" />
                        <p>
                            The launchers main task is to be the mittleman between server and client regarding updates and news.<br>
                            This means that our testers only have to download the game ones as the launcher detects new versions, downloads them and applies the new version.<br>
                            We implemented a failsafe on the client, which will shut the game down if the game is not launched through the launcher, in case that this feature is attempted to be bypassed.
                        </p>
