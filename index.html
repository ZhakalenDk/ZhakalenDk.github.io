					Once Upon a time:
				</p>
				<p id=StoryText>
					Two friends were watching a video called<br>
					"<a id=link href="https://youtu.be/GKC3pFUqqjw">Actual Canibal 'Shia Labeouf'(Skyrim)</a>" on YouTube.
					They had such a laugh that they invented an internal game among the two of them.
					<br>The 'Shia Labeouf' Game. A tactical game that requers stealh and... and an IQ above 8...
					However...
					The rules are simple:<br>
					You have to trick your opponent into hearing,
					seing or in any other way be exposed to the words('Shia Labeouf').
					If your opponnent is expecting it, it simply does not count.
					You have to figure out ways to expose him/her
					to the words without them knowing that they are about to get exposed.
					<br>
					<br>
					As time passed they got more engaged in the game and figured out
					some pretty creative ways to expose each other to the words.
					One of them were good at this and took the lead in "Labeouf Counts".
					But while the one was ahead...
					The other one was planning a big trick to settle the scores and even the "Labeouf Count".
					A trick that would be so great, genius and random that both would agree to settling the score.
					He worked day and night until he finally developed the perfect trick.
					The 'Shia Labeouf' Game Website...
					If your reading this.... You have been exposed more than anyone before you!
					You have been "LABEOUFED motherfucker!
					Count the "Shia Labouf's on this website....
					Yea... That's right... Suck it bitch!
