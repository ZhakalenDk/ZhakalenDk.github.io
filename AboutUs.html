							We're a small Indie Group of 3 people
							located in Southern Denmark.<br>
							We're Gamers ourself!<br>
							We're as much driven by good stories, beautiful
							visuals and stunning Original Gameplay as you are.<br>
							Despite the fact that we do have knowledge
							and we're able to find a solution to many things
							we're still learning, which means we're building our
							bout while sailing it.<br>

						<p>
							We always wanted to make a game and one
							day at a Party we ended up talking about it.<br>
							We quickly realised that this could actually
							become reality, so we began working on it.
							We could fill 3 roles, which was were we began.<br>
							<br>
							* Writer
							<br>
							* Level Designer
							<br>
							* Programmer
							<br>
							<br>
							We sat down, brainstormed and ended up here<br>
							About to make our first game! This is so exciting!
