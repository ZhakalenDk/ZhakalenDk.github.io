				<p>Who we are</p>
				<div id="Info">
					<p>
						We're a small Indie Group of 4 people
						located in Southern Denmark.<br>
						We're Gamers ourselves!<br>
						We're intrigued by good storyline, beautiful
						visuals and stunning Original Gameplay as much as you are.<br>
						Despite the fact that we're still learning we do have a lot of
						knowledge and we always find a solution to every problem,<br>
						which means we're building our
						boat while we're sailing it.<br>

				<p>How did we get here?</p>
				<div id="Info">
					<p>
						
					
						We always wanted to make a game and one
						day at a Party we ended up talking about it.<br>
						We quickly realised that this could actually
						become reality, so we began working on it.
						We could fill 3 roles, which was where we began.<br>
						<br>
						* Writer
						<br>
						* Level Designer
						<br>
						* Programmer
						<br>
						<br>
						We sat down, brainstormed and ended up here<br>
						About to make our first game! This is so exciting!
