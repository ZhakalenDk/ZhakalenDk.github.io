							If you're looking for a place on the team,<br>
							please note that you will not get payed for
							any service.<br>
							The reason for this is that we're a small
							Indie team with limited resources, <br>
							which means that we have no funding and
							we're not looking for it either.<br>
							<br>
							We began our work The 20th of July and we're
							slowly making progress.
							You will therefore be a part of a,
							with you, growing team.<br>
							A team you will not work for but work with.<br>
							<br>
							If our project at any point provides income<br>
							all participants will of course get their
							share of the cake.<br>
							<br>
							
							As we're doing everything ourselves
							we do not pay any third party for services.
							Everyting will be made by the few hands we have.
							If you would like to get your hands in on the project
							feel welcome to contact us. <br>
							<br>
							Remember to state, which role you're looking to fill
							and we will look into it.
							You do not need to be a proffesional but we
							do require you to be able to work independently.
							This means that you have to own a particular level
							of skill in the field you want to be a part of.
