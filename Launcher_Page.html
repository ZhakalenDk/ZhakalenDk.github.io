                                There will be more information about this region when the time comes.

                    <p>
                        On 23rd of November we will release the a detailed schedule that will cover the updates for the rest of the year
                    </p>
                
                   <h3>What's new?</h3>
                    <p>
                        As the 4th version of the Game Loop is a combination of every basic feature you have been testing so far, it will not contain any new features besides "God Mode", which is a Testers Tool to quickly travel the world while flying along with 10X health, stamina and damage.(Just a "I'm immortal" mode in case you got bored of running)<br>
                        There is one major change though!<br>
                        We're happy to announce that we've replaced Unity's default Launcher with our own hand written Launcher.<br>
                        The launcher will be updated as we progress through the development. We're working on a patch system to spare you of the trouble of downloading the whole game every single time we update the build.<br>
                        We're sorry that you have to go through that... Really... We are!<br><br>
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>How does it work?</h3>
                    <p>
                        From the Launcher you can of course launch the game, but you can also tag along on our newsfeed (And visit our Website... But that's not as cool is it?).<br>
                        The launcher has access to a newsfeed server, which contains patch notes and other information.
                        You will not have to reinstall the Launcher in order to get your news.<br>
                        The best part is.. You do not have to go to <a href="https://trello.com/" target="blank">Trello</a> (And sign in) in order to download a new build.<br> The Launcher will detect if there's a new version available and prompt you to download and install it.
                        However, as stated above the system will download the whole game everytime which is not a clean solution, we're working on that!<br><br>
                        
                        We'll be giving some more information on the "Patch system" progress when we're ready to show you!<br>

                        Enjoy and happy testing!
