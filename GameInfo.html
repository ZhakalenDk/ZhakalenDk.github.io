                            The game is set in an open 2.5D medievel fantasy world. <br>
                            Our idea is to build a game where our 'Hero' is not actually a hero but rather an antagonist, we want to differ from the normal 'Hero' approach that most games today is taking.
                            This also means that the player will have to decide to be evil or even brutal in givin situations.
                            You Will Do Evil will be a mix of action, humor, bad language, crazy folks, murder, blood you name it.
                            We want the player to feel powerful and free... and placed in an over the top brutal world with plenty of stuff to establish a love/hate relationship onto.

						The short story of You Will Do Evil
					</p>
					<div id="NewText">
						<p>
							In the country of Vensindah, a terrible war of succession was waged between two brothers after the death of their father, the King of Vensindah.<br>
                            One brother sought the aid of a renowned band of mercenaries known as the Harbingers in an effort to win the war, and with their help he succeeded. Now with the war won, the Harbingers were tasked with one last mission; to kill one of their own, namely Sarenn Bright, a merciless warrior of great skill.<br>
                            The reason for their betrayal, known only to the highest ranking amongst the Harbingers, was a highly kept secret, at the order of the new king. So all but a few of the Harbingers turned on their own, out of promised riches and titles in the new kingdom, and thusly spelled the doom of Sarenn. Unbeknownst to them though, the warrior survived the onslaught and with hatred in his heart he sought to cut a bloody path through Vensindah to find the truth of his betrayal and slake his thirst for vengeance. You will do evil, and pay them back in kind for what they did unto you.
